#
#      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
#      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
#      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
#      and conversions to other media types.
#
#      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
#      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
#      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
#      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
#
#      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
#      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
#      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
#      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
#      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
#      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
#      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
#
#      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
#      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
#      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
#      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
#      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
#      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

#      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
#
#      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
#      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
#      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
#
#   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
#      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
#      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
#      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
#      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
#      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
#
#   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
#      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
#      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
#      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
#      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
#      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
#      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
#      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
#      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
#      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
#      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
#      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
#      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
#      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
#      as of the date such litigation is filed.
#
#   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
#      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
#      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
#      meet the following conditions:
#
#      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
#          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
#
#      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
#          stating that You changed the files; and
#
#      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
#          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
#          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
#          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
#          the Derivative Works; and
#
#      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
#          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
#          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
#          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
#          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
#          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
#          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
#          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
#          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
#          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
#          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
#          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
#          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
#          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
#          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
#          as modifying the License.
#
#      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
#      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
#      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
#      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
#      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
#      the conditions stated in this License.
#
#   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
#      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
#      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
#      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
#      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
#      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
#      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
#
#   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
#      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
#      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
#      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
#
#   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
#      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
#      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
#      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
#      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
#      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
#      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
#      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
#      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
#
#   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
#      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
#      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
#      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
#      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
#      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
#      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
#      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
#      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
#      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
#      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
#
#   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
#      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
#      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
#      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
#      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
#      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
#      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
#      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
#      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
#      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
