- Template based or plain K8s manifests is stored in the neco-apps repository.
- CI runs light-weight test, named "kindtest", for topic branches.  To verify changed manifests deploy, CI runs bootstrap tests on [kind][] (Kubernetes IN Docker).
- To merge `master` branch to `stage` branch, CI runs full-scale test, named "dctest".  CI emulates a datacenter environment on GCP instances and runs bootstrap/upgrade tests on those instances.
- [Argo CD][] watches changes of this repository, then synchronize(deploy) automatically when new commit detected.
- After the deployment process finished, [Argo CD][] sends alert to the [Alertmanager][] where is running on the same cluster. Then it notifies to Slack channel and/or Email address.

GCP instance
------------

This repository uses Google Compute Engine instance for GitOps testing. The instances are automatically created and deleted by [CircleCI][] depending on the job contents.

The GCP instance name is `neco-apps-<CircleCI Build Number>`. If the job succeeds, the corresponding GCP instance will be deleted immediately. When the job failed, the GCP instance remains for a while.

CircleCI Workflow
-----------------

This repository has 4 CircleCI workflows, `main`, `daily`, `manual-dctest` and `production-release`.

### `main` workflow

`main` workflow is used for testing feature branch of `neco-apps`. This consists of the following 2 jobs.

| job name   | description              | target branch                                                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `test`     | Syntax check for go lang | all branches                                                                      |
| `kindtest` | Bootstrap test on kind   | all branches except `master`, `stage`, `release`, `op-release-*` and `op-stage-*` |

### `daily` workflow

`daily` workflow is executed daily for merging `master` to `stage`.  This consists of the following 4 jobs.

| job name                    | description                                                                            | target branch |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `bootstrap`                 | Bootstrap test on GCP instances                                                        | `master`      |
| `upgrade-stage`             | Upgrade test from `stage` branch (staging env)                                         | `master`      |
| `upgrade-release`           | Upgrade test from `release` branch (production env)                                    | `master`      |
| `create-pull-request-stage` | Create PR to stage, then trigger `create-pull-request-stage` of the secret repository. | `master`      |

`update-stage` is executed only if 3 other jobs succeeded.

### `manual-dctest` workflow

`manual-dctest` workflow is not executed automatically.  This provides full-scale test for all branches, which can be triggered from Web UI.

This consists of the following 6 jobs.

| job name                    | description                                                                            | target branch                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bootstrap`                 | Bootstrap test on GCP instances                                                        | all branches                                                                      |
| `upgrade-master`            | Upgrade test from `master` branch                                                      | all branches except `master`, `stage`, `release`, `op-release-*` and `op-stage-*` |
| `upgrade-stage`             | Upgrade test from `stage` branch (staging env)                                         | all branches                                                                      |

### `manual-dctest-with-neco-feature-branch` workflow

`manual-dctest-with-neco-feature-branch` workflow is not executed automatically. This can be triggered from Web UI.

This consists of the following job.

| job name                     | description                                 | target branch                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bootstrap-with-neco-branch` | Bootstrap test with `neco`'s feature branch | all branches except `master`, `stage`, `release`, `op-release-*` and `op-stage-*` |

`bootstrap-with-neco-branch` is tested with `neco`'s feature branch which is the same name as `neco-apps`'s target branch name.
For example, when `foo-bar` branch of `neco-apps`, it's tested with `foo-bar` branch of `neco`.

### `release-tag` workflow

`release-tag` workflow is used for pushing release tag to stage HEAD.
This workflow is executed only when a PR is merged to stage branch.

### `production-release` workflow

`production-release` workflow is used for releasing `neco-apps` to a production environment.
This workflow is executed only when a `release-*` tag is created. And it creates a pull request for the release.

CD of each cluster
------------------

See details of the deployment step in [deploy.md](deploy.md).

- stage: watch `argocd-config/overlays/stage<num>` in **stage HEAD** branch. All changes of `stage` are always deployed to staging cluster.
- prod (tokyo0, osaka0, ...): watch `argocd-config/overlays/{tokyo<num>,osaka<num>}` in **release HEAD** branch. To deploy changes for a production cluster.
